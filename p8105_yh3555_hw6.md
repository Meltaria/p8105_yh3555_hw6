## Problem 2

Import data

``` r
homicide = read.csv("./data./homicide-data.csv")
```

Date cleaning

``` r
homicide_clean = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state)) %>%
  mutate(city_state = as.factor(city_state)) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL"),
         !victim_age %in% c(NA),
         !victim_sex %in% c("Unknown")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  mutate(resolved = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest"), 1, 0)) %>%
  select(-uid, -reported_date, -victim_last, -victim_first, -lat, -lon)
```

    ## # … with 39,352 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​disposition,
    ## #   ²​city_state, ³​resolved

If the case was closed by arrested, which was solved, it would be
labelled as 1. If Open/No arrest or Closed without arrest, it would be
labelled as 0.

For Baltimore,MD

``` r
baltimore_fit = homicide_clean %>%
  filter(city_state %in% c("Baltimore,MD")) %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())
baltimore_fit
```

    ## 
    ## Call:  glm(formula = resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    ##     family = binomial(), data = .)
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##      (Intercept)        victim_age  victim_raceWhite    victim_sexMale  
    ##         0.309981         -0.006727          0.841756         -0.854463  
    ## 
    ## Degrees of Freedom: 2752 Total (i.e. Null);  2749 Residual
    ## Null Deviance:       3568 
    ## Residual Deviance: 3493  AIC: 3501

``` r
baltimore_tidy = broom::tidy(baltimore_fit)
```

The OR and CI of baltimore can be obtained.

``` r
baltimore_tidy %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  filter(term %in% c("victim_sexMale")) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, ci_lower, ci_upper) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term           | log_OR |    OR | ci_lower | ci_upper |
|:---------------|-------:|------:|---------:|---------:|
| victim_sexMale | -0.854 | 0.426 |    0.325 |    0.558 |

For all cities

``` r
nest_city = homicide_clean %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>%
  mutate(
    models = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data= ., family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  select(-data, -models) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  filter(term %in% c("victim_sexMale")) %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  select(city_state, term, estimate, std.error)
```

OR an CI

``` r
city_data = nest_city %>%
   mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, ci_lower, ci_upper)
```

    ## Adding missing grouping variables: `city_state`

building plot

``` r
city_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~term) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 80, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 3

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making
this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

    One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)
    One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal” Import data

``` r
bw = read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

Let’s hypothesize that the birthweight may have linear regression model
with mother’s mother’s age at delivery. Let’s clean the data

``` r
bw_tidy = bw %>%
  select(bwt, momage) %>%
  filter(!bwt %in% c(NA),
         !momage %in% c(NA))
```

build linear model

``` r
linear_mod1 = lm(bwt ~ momage, data = bw_tidy)
```

Build plot

``` r
bw_tidy %>%
  add_predictions(linear_mod1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = momage, y =bwt)) + geom_point(alpha = .5) + geom_line(aes(y=pred), color = "red") 
```

![](p8105_yh3555_hw6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

Let’s build the other two models

``` r
model2 = bw %>%
  select(bwt, blength, gaweeks) %>%
  filter(!bwt %in% c(NA),
         !blength %in% c(NA),
         !gaweeks %in% c(NA))
linear_model2 = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = model2)
```

``` r
model3 = bw %>%
  select(bwt, bhead, blength, babysex) %>%
  filter(!bwt %in% c(NA),
         !bhead%in% c(NA),
         !blength%in% c(NA),
         !babysex %in% c(NA))
linear_model3 = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex, data = model3)
```
