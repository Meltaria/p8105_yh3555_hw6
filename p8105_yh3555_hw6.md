## Problem 1

To download the data.

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

“modelr::bootstrap” was used to draw the samples and “broom::Glance” was
used to produce “r.squared” values.

``` r
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_density()
```

![](p8105_yh3555_hw6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

From the example, we may find that the r-squared value is high, and the
upper bound at 1 may cause the generally skewed shape of the
distribution. In order to construct a CI for r-squared, the 2.5% and
97.5% quantiles of the estimates would be taken. A distribution for
log(beta0 \* beta1) was also produced.

``` r
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(id = `.id`, term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = term, 
    values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(beta0 = `(Intercept)`, beta1 = tmin) %>% 
  mutate(log_b0b1 = log(beta0 * beta1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b0b1)) + geom_density()
```

![](p8105_yh3555_hw6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- --> The
distribution is skewed and has some outliers.

## Problem 2

Import data

``` r
homicide = read.csv("./data./homicide-data.csv")
```

Date cleaning

``` r
homicide_clean = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state)) %>%
  mutate(city_state = as.factor(city_state)) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL"),
         !victim_age %in% c(NA),
         !victim_sex %in% c("Unknown")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  mutate(resolved = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest"), 1, 0)) %>%
  select(-uid, -reported_date, -victim_last, -victim_first, -lat, -lon)
```

    ## 10 White               20 Male       Albuquerque NM    Closed b… Albuqu…       1
    ## # … with 39,352 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​disposition,
    ## #   ²​city_state, ³​resolved

The imported data was cleaned. City and state was joined into a new
variable “city_state” via str_c(). City_state was factorized and
victim_age was numerized. City_state “Dallas,TX”, “Phoenix,AZ”, “Kansas
City,MO”, “Tulsa,AL” were excluded. The victim race only include Black
and White. If the case was closed by arrested, which was solved, it
would be labelled as 1. If Open/No arrest or Closed without arrest, it
would be labelled as 0. Finnaly, some unnecessary variables were
excluded.

For Baltimore,MD, The data of Baltimore,MD was filered and the glm was
built based on the resolved vs victim_age and victim_sex. Broom::tidy
was used for better reading.

``` r
baltimore_fit = homicide_clean %>%
  filter(city_state %in% c("Baltimore,MD")) %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())
baltimore_fit
```

    ## 
    ## Call:  glm(formula = resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    ##     family = binomial(), data = .)
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##      (Intercept)        victim_age  victim_raceWhite    victim_sexMale  
    ##         0.309981         -0.006727          0.841756         -0.854463  
    ## 
    ## Degrees of Freedom: 2752 Total (i.e. Null);  2749 Residual
    ## Null Deviance:       3568 
    ## Residual Deviance: 3493  AIC: 3501

``` r
baltimore_tidy = broom::tidy(baltimore_fit)
```

From the tidied binary outcome, was can obtained the OR via its
estimate. The OR and CI of baltimore can be obtained. Kinitr::kable was
used for a cleared view.

``` r
baltimore_tidy %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  filter(term %in% c("victim_sexMale")) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, ci_lower, ci_upper) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term           | log_OR |    OR | ci_lower | ci_upper |
|:---------------|-------:|------:|---------:|---------:|
| victim_sexMale | -0.854 | 0.426 |    0.325 |    0.558 |

For all cities Let’s repeat the smiliar procedure but utilize map to
apply the model building for all the city_state data and unnest the
result in the end. Victim_sexMale was chosen via filter as the OR and CI
comparing male victims to female victims was required.

``` r
nest_city = homicide_clean %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>%
  mutate(
    models = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data= ., family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>%
  select(-data, -models) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  filter(term %in% c("victim_sexMale")) %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  select(city_state, term, estimate, std.error)
```

Similar procedure was done to obtained OR and CI range.

``` r
city_data = nest_city %>%
   mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96*std.error),
         ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96*std.error)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, ci_lower, ci_upper)
```

    ## Adding missing grouping variables: `city_state`

Plot was built based on the city data via ggplot. Error bars were
created via geom_error bar.

``` r
city_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax= ci_upper)) +
  facet_wrap(~term) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 80, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 3

Import data

``` r
bw = read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

Let’s eradicate all the missing values in the dataset. All numeric
variable’s missing data were excluded while the descriptive variables
were converted into factors.

``` r
bw_tidy = bw %>%
  filter(!bwt %in% c(NA),
         !momage %in% c(NA),
         !delwt %in% c(NA),
         !blength %in% c(NA),
         !fincome %in% c(NA),
         !gaweeks %in% c(NA),
         !menarche %in% c(NA),
         !mheight %in% c(NA),
         !parity %in% c(NA),
         !pnumlbw %in% c(NA),
         !pnumsga %in% c(NA),
         !ppbmi %in% c(NA),
         !ppwt %in% c(NA),
         !smoken %in% c(NA),
         !wtgain %in% c(NA)) %>%
  
  mutate(babysex = as.factor(babysex),
         malform = as.factor(malform),
         mrace = as.factor(mrace),
         frace = as.factor(frace),
         id = 1:nrow(bw))
```

### Building and check hypothesized model

The babies’ birth weight may be related to their head circumstance and
closely related to mother’s health condition during pregnancy. Let’s
hypothesize that the birthweight has a linear regression relationship
with head circumference, mother’s weight at delivery, average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy, weight gained during
pregnancy. Let’s build models.

``` r
mod1_lm = lm(bwt ~ blength + delwt + smoken + wtgain, data = bw_tidy)
summary(mod1_lm)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = bwt ~ blength + delwt + smoken + wtgain, data = bw_tidy)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
    ## -1696.8  -219.2    -6.3   209.5  4297.9 
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    ## (Intercept) -3872.6958    95.1897 -40.684  < 2e-16 ***
    ## blength       132.5746     1.9348  68.520  < 2e-16 ***
    ## delwt           2.2489     0.2568   8.757  < 2e-16 ***
    ## smoken         -2.4925     0.6893  -3.616 0.000303 ***
    ## wtgain          3.3692     0.5161   6.529 7.41e-11 ***
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    ## 
    ## Residual standard error: 334.9 on 4337 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.5727, Adjusted R-squared:  0.5723 
    ## F-statistic:  1453 on 4 and 4337 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

According to the summary of the model, we can find out taht all the
p-value of the variables are smaller than 0.05, indicating all these
variables have a significant association with the birth weight. The
adjusted R-squared is 0.5723, explaining 57,23% of the variability in
birthweight.

Let’s check the model fit and and the assumption via plotting residuals
and fitted values. Add_residuals and add_prediction would be used in the
this.

``` r
bw_tidy_1 = bw_tidy %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(mod1_lm) %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(mod1_lm)

bw_tidy_1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs Predicted",
       x = "Predicted value",
       y = "Residuals")
```

![](p8105_yh3555_hw6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->
From the plot, we can found that the most of the points are in a type of
linearity. There are still some outliers for some extreme predicted
values.

### Cross Validation

Let’s build the models of the other two models.

``` r
mod2_lm = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = bw_tidy)
summary(mod2_lm)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:

    ## Residual standard error: 333.2 on 4339 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.5769, Adjusted R-squared:  0.5767 
    ## F-statistic:  2958 on 2 and 4339 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

``` r
mod3_lm = lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex, data = bw_tidy)
summary(mod3_lm)
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + 
    ##     bhead * babysex + blength * babysex, data = bw_tidy)

    ## F-statistic:  1563 on 6 and 4335 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

Let’s compare our models with the other two given models via
corss-validation to assess prediction accuracy.

``` r
cv_mods = crossv_mc(bw_tidy_1, 1000) %>%
  mutate(train = map(train, as_tibble),
         test = map(test, as_tibble))

cv_mods_1 = cv_mods %>%
  mutate(
    mod1_lm = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + delwt + smoken + wtgain, data = .x)),
    mod2_lm = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    mod3_lm = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength + bhead*babysex + blength*babysex, data = .x))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    rmse_1 = map2_dbl(mod1_lm, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_2 = map2_dbl(mod2_lm, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_3 = map2_dbl(mod3_lm, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
  )
```

We have got the cross_validation of there three models, and also got the
RMSE values too. Thus, we may plot the distribution of RMSE values to
check all these 3 models.

``` r
cv_mods_1 %>%
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", values_to ="rmse", names_prefix = "rmse_") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + geom_violin() + 
  labs(title = "RMSE of three models",
       x = "Models",
       y = "RMSE")
```

![](p8105_yh3555_hw6_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

For the plots shown, the model 3 seems to be most prediction accurate
with smallest RMSE. Thus model 3 with head circumference, length, sex
and all three interactions can be the most optimal one.
