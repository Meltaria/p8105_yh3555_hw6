## Problem 2

Import data

``` r
homicide = read.csv("./data./homicide-data.csv")
```

Date cleaning

``` r
homicide = homicide %>%
  select(-uid, -reported_date, -victim_last, -victim_first, -lat, -lon)%>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state)) %>%
  mutate(city_state = as.factor(city_state)) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  mutate(resolved = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest"), 1, 0))
```

    ## # … with 39,683 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​disposition,
    ## #   ²​city_state, ³​resolved

If the case was closed by arrested, which was solved, it would be
labelled as 1. If Open/No arrest or Closed without arrest, it would be
labelled as 0.

For Baltimore,MD

``` r
baltimore_fit = homicide %>%
  filter(city_state %in% c("Baltimore,MD")) %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())
baltimore_fit
```
