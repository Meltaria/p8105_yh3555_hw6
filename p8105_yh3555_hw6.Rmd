## Problem 2
Import data
```{r}
homicide = read.csv("./data./homicide-data.csv")
```

Date cleaning
```{r}
homicide_clean = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state)) %>%
  mutate(city_state = as.factor(city_state)) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL"),
         !victim_age %in% c(NA),
         !victim_sex %in% c("Unknown")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  mutate(resolved = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest"), 1, 0)) %>%
  select(-uid, -reported_date, -victim_last, -victim_first, -lat, -lon)
homicide_clean
```
If the case was closed by arrested, which was solved, it would be labelled as 1. If Open/No arrest or Closed without arrest, it would be labelled as 0. 

For Baltimore,MD
```{r}
baltimore_fit = homicide_clean %>%
  filter(city_state %in% c("Baltimore,MD")) %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())
baltimore_fit
baltimore_tidy = broom::tidy(baltimore_fit)
```

```{r}
CI_baltimore = baltimore_fit %>%
  confint(level = 0.95)
OR_baltimore = baltimore_tidy %>%
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%
  select(term, OR)
```
For all cities
```{r}
cities_fit = homicide_clean %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>%
  mutate(
    models = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data= ., family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>%
  select(-data, -models) %>%
  unnest(results) %>%
  filter(!term %in% c("(Intercept)"))
cities_fit

```



## Problem 3
Import data
```{r}
bw = read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```
