```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(mgcv)
library(readr)
set.seed(1)
```


## Problem 2
Import data
```{r}
homicide = read.csv("./data./homicide-data.csv")
```

Date cleaning
```{r}
homicide = homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state)) %>%
  mutate(city_state = as.factor(city_state)) %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  group_by(city_state, disposition) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX", "Phoenix,AZ", "Kansas City,MO", "Tulsa,AL")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>%
  mutate(status = ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed by arrest"), 1, 0))
homicide
```
If the case was closed by arrested, which was solved, it would be labelled as 1. If Open/No arrest or Closed without arrest, it would be labelled as 0.
